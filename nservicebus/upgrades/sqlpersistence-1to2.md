## Inheriting from SqlSaga now required

In Version 1 inheriting from `NServiceBus.Saga<T>` was partially supported. However this having two competing approaches that deliver the same features caused significant confusion. In Version 2 `NServiceBus.Saga<T>` is no longer supported and either a build error, or an runtime exception for some edge cases, will occur.


## Explicit schema API

An explicit schema API has been added.

snippet: 1to2_Schema

If characters required quoting were previously used in the table prefix, they can be removed and the following used:

snippet: 1to2_Schema_Extended

WARNING: An exception will be thrown if any of ], [ or &grave; are detected in the `tablePrefix` or the schema.


## SqlSaga.ConfigureMapping made abstract

To simplify implementing a saga using `SqlSaga<T>` the method `SqlSaga<T>.ConfigureMapping` has been made abstract and now always needs to be implemented even if no message mapping is required.


## Missing Indexs

Some missing indexes have been added. These indexes will be added the next time the [installers](/nservicebus/sql-persistence/#installation) are executed. No explicit SQL migration is required.


### TimeoutData

 * Add missing non-unique index on `Time`, for query to find expired timeouts
 * Add missing non-unique index on `SagaId`, used for clearing timeouts from completed sagas


### OutboxData

* Add missing index on `Dispatched (bool)`
* Add missing index on `DispatchedAt (datetime)`
